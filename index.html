What are people doing to get marijuana legalized?
I think theses activities will have the most influence on how your game is designed.
Research, Protest, Policy Advocacy (have a their character go to the computer and look up info on the subject, then a pop up appears and they’ll have to highlight info they want on their poster).
( after make a poster you it’ll be judged on info and if the poster is bad you’ll get low points and if the poster is good it’ll give you more points ) 
( as the leader of the protest group if you’ve get enough points
